2. Five key features of SQL Server:

Data Storage and Retrieval: Supports complex queries to manage large volumes of data efficiently.

Security: Supports user authentication, encryption, and roles.

Backup and Restore: Built-in support for backing up and restoring databases.

High Availability: Features like Always On, Replication, and Clustering.

Integration Services: Tools for data integration (SSIS), reporting (SSRS), and analysis (SSAS).

3. Authentication Modes in SQL Server:

Windows Authentication Mode:
Uses Windows user accounts for access control.

);

6. Differences between SQL Server, SSMS, and SQL:
Term	Description
SQL Server	A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) by Microsoft that stores and retrieves data.
SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)	A GUI tool for managing SQL Server databases. Allows writing queries, designing tables, and managing servers.
SQL (Structured Query Language)	A language used to interact with relational databases. It is used to query, insert, update, and delete data.

7. Different SQL Commands:
Command Type	Full Form	Purpose	Example
DQL	Data Query Language	Used to fetch data	SELECT * FROM Students;
DML	Data Manipulation Language	Insert, update, delete data	INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'John', 20);
DDL	Data Definition Language	Create, alter, drop structures	CREATE TABLE Students (...);
DCL	Data Control Language	Control access to data	GRANT SELECT ON Students TO User1;
TCL	Transaction Control Language	Manage transactions	BEGIN TRANSACTION; COMMIT; ROLLBACK;
8. Insert 3 records into the Students table:
INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age)
VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 18),
(2, 'Bob', 19),
(3, 'Charlie', 20);
